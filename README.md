ASP .NET Core 3.1Worker Service Sample


# WHAT IS A .NET CORE WORKER SERVICE?

A worker service is a .NET project built using a template which supplies a few useful features that turn a regular console application into something more powerful. 
A worker service runs on top of the concept of a host, which maintains the lifetime of the application. 
The host also makes available some familiar features, such as dependency injection, logging and configuration.

Worker services will generally be long-running services, performing some regularly occurring workload.




# EXAMPLES OF WORKER SERVICES:

 - Processing messages/events from a queue, service bus or event stream
 
 - Reacting to file changes in an object/file store
 
 - Aggregating data from a data store
 
 - Enriching data in data ingestion pipelines
 
 - Formatting and cleansing of AI/ML datasets
